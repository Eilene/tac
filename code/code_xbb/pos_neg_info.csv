Hi Pimky,

Im sorry your having such a rough time at the moment, ex's can be a nightmare!My husband has been going through courts trying to see his daughter for the past 8 years and basically most judges will want the children to have stability, The judge granted us access every other weekend from Fri after school to Sun afternoon which is what your ex was having so i think that is acceptable,

If you explain to your lawyer that you want your children to see their dad every other weekend as before then its likely his laywer will say there isnt really any point in going to court as you are allowing access, Your ex may try and get a little more access and this can result in letters between laywers

It also looks good for you that he didnt attend mediation, It makes HIM look unreansonable

If he doesnt have parental responsability and you are fine with him having it then ask your lawyer to sort it out, My husband has parental responsability of his daughter and basically all in means is that he will be informed if god forbid my step daughter was in and accident, He can contact her school for information about attendance etc

Dont worry about SS if he does call them they may come and see you but if you are coping and the kids are safe then they wont get involved

Good luck and keep your chin upNone",39280a4d31d81837e17469e18a854116,ent-27,PER,specific,m-459,your lawyer,NOM,2484,pos

Hi Pimky,

Im sorry your having such a rough time at the moment, ex's can be a nightmare!My husband has been going through courts trying to see his daughter for the past 8 years and basically most judges will want the children to have stability, The judge granted us access every other weekend from Fri after school to Sun afternoon which is what your ex was having so i think that is acceptable,

If you explain to your lawyer that you want your children to see their dad every other weekend as before then its likely his laywer will say there isnt really any point in going to court as you are allowing access, Your ex may try and get a little more access and this can result in letters between laywers

It also looks good for you that he didnt attend mediation, It makes HIM look unreansonable

If he doesnt have parental responsability and you are fine with him having it then ask your lawyer to sort it out, My husband has parental responsability of his daughter and basically all in means is that he will be informed if god forbid my step daughter was in and accident, He can contact her school for information about attendance etc

Dont worry about SS if he does call them they may come and see you but if you are coping and the kids are safe then they wont get involved

Good luck and keep your chin upNone",39280a4d31d81837e17469e18a854116,ent-18,PER,specific,m-339,HIM,PRO,2373,neg

Recent cases of possible mistaken execution

* Virginia executed Joseph O'Dell on July 23, 1997 despite the existence of DNA evidence that could have proved O'Dell's innocence.The courts refused to consider this new evidence because Virginia law says that any evidence found after 21 days is inadmissible in proving the innocence of a convicted person.* Texas executed Jesse Jacobs on January 4, 1995 despite the prosecution's admission that arguments they made at Jacobs' trial were false.",4deb48e2b0ab194ce37c1bd31c73586a,ent-114,ORG,specific,m-648,The courts,NOM,1421,neg
Coleman's appellate attorneys misread the statute governing the time frame for submitting an appeal and filed their brief one day too late.The Virginia state courts held that the one-day-late filing was the equivalent of no filing at all and refused to review his issues.The federal courts subsequently held that Coleman could not raise a federal claim because he had waived his state review.,4deb48e2b0ab194ce37c1bd31c73586a,ent-114,ORG,specific,m-654,The Virginia state courts,NOM,3069,neg
"On the federal level, 3.5% of persons whom the Attorney General has attempted to execute have been innocent.In one example of state-level problems, Illinois (prior to Governor Ryan's blanket commutation) had an error rate of at least 4.5%.(American Civil Liberties Union)
* A study identified 23 instances in the last century in which a person with an extraordinarily strong case of innocence had been executed by the government.",4deb48e2b0ab194ce37c1bd31c73586a,ent-138,GPE,specific,m-780,Illinois,NAM,849,neg
